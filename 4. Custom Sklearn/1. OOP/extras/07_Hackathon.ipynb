    "- 2+ players in a game\n",
    "- Each player gets one full deck of cards, shuffled\n",
    "- Each player deals 15 cards and discards them\n",
    "- With the remaining cards, the players add up the total number of face cards (J, Q, K)\n",
    "- The player with the most face cards wins\n",
    "- If there is a draw, the player with the most Ks wins (then most Qs, Js etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this challenge is to use the `__lt__`, `__gt__`, `__eq__`, `__ge__`, `__le__` dunder methods to compare the decks with the remaining cards."
