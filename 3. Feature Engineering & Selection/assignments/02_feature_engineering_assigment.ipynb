    "Your goal is to create a classification system that can determine the author of a given piece of text purely based on the textual information present. For this purpose, we assume a given author always creates content within the same genre - no reason to expect a BuzzFeed-style article from Jane Austen. \n",

    "**ASSIGNMENT**: Discuss in small groups what features you would engineer for this type of problem. \n",

    "These features could, for instance, be related to: \n",
    "- **Content:** In order to use text data for classification purposes, the text must be converted to a set of representative numerical features. One of the simplest methods is of encoding text data is by _word counts_. This may be used to get a feeling for content, e.g. by identifying topics through keywords. \n",
    "- **Lexical features**: features based on the words present in the document, e.g. average document length. \n",
    "- **Syntactic features**: features based on the underlying grammar of the document. Assume you have access to a part-of-speech tagger which can identify the word classes (e.g. noun, verb, adjective, adverbs, etc.) for all the words in the document. [Example](http://www.nltk.org/book/ch05.html).\n",
