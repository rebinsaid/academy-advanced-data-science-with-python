    "A former colleague of yours was working on a promising data-focused project, but unfortunately he recently got fired (for unknown reasons), so you are taking the project over. **Your goal** will be to kickstart this project, and turn it into a successful data-driven use case rather than an immature experimental notebook that it is right now. You will have to **improve the approach** started by your colleague, **rethink** some of the more immature techniques, **substantially expand and reinforce** the project, as well as verify that it actually brings business value.\n",

    "You are working for a bike rental company that hopes to optimize its bicycle availability at various rental locations. You have access to their past data that contains the hourly and daily count of bike rentals between years 2011 and 2012 with the corresponding weather and seasonal information. Our target variable is **cnt** - the number of bikes rented out at a particular moment. Below is a description of the remaining variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **datetime**: date and time when each log of bike rentals was made\n",
    "- **weathersit**: weather situation at the moment of the log \n",

    "    2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist\n",
    "    3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds\n",
    "    4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog\n",
    "- **temp**: Normalized temperature in Celsius. The values are derived via (t-tmin)/(tmax-tmin), tmin=-8, t_max=+39 \n",
    "- **atemp**: Normalized feeling temperature in Celsius. The values are derived via (t-tmin)/(tmax-tmin), tmin=-16, t_max=+50\n",
    "- **hum**: Normalized humidity. The values are divided to 100 (max)\n",
    "- **windspeed**: Normalized wind speed. The values are divided to 67 (max)\n",
    "- **registered**: count of registered users among those who rented bikes\n",
    "- **cnt**: count of all rental bikes including both unregistered and registered users\n",
